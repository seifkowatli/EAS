<p> Educational assessment is the systematic process of documenting and using empirical data on the knowledge, skill, attitudes, and beliefs to refine programs and improve student learning.

We have two cores of EAS Examination and Assessment. Each one of them have its own API and provide multiple services. The examination core handles the examination process , which starts with creating the exam and generating the exam questions pattern,and ending with questions correction and grading. While the Assessment core handles assessment and analysis.
Those cores provide these services to the ASP.MVC Endpoints which request the services present it to the end user in a user-friendly look.
Since the information we work with is confidential, we put a lot of effort into the security part of the project and used encryption to ensure that the data is safe.
Our system algorithms can be used to perform two types of assessment; summative, placement and formative assessment. In our University case study our main focus was the summative assessment.
